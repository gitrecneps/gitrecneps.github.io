        <i>Landmarks of Library Literature 1876–1976, Dianne J. Ellsworth and Norman D. Stevens</i>
        </p>
        <p>
        A provision of endless apparatus, a bustle of infinite inquiry and research, may be employed to evade and shuffle off real labor--the real labor of thinking.
        </p>
        <p>
        When it is said, therefore, that a librarian is a keeper of books, it must be determined first of which of these two books he is the keeper. Is he, for example, the keeper of the small, clothbound object [. . .], or is he the keeper of that very different object created in many mens minds before, and now in yours, by this--these words, these symbols, images, perceptions [. . .]. 
        </p>
        <p>
        It makes a difference whether the book is the cloth and paper or the intellectual image. If it is the physical book of which the librarian is the keeper, then the character of his profession is obvious enough. He is a custodian as all keepers of physical objects are custodians, and his obligations are a custodian’s obligations. He is a sort of check boy in a parcel room of culture. His duty is to receive the priceless packages confided to him by the past and to redeliver them to the future against the proper stub. To perform that obligation he must be reliable, orderly, industrious, and clever. He must devise infallible and complicated ticket systems to find the parcels on the shelves. He must read the notations of origin and ownership in a dozen tongues. He must guard the wrappers from the risks of time and theft. And matches an men’s thumbs. He must be courteous and patient with the claimants. And for the rest he has no duty but to wait. If no one comes, if no one questions, he can wait.
        </p>
        <p>
        But if it is not the physical book but the intellectual book of which the librarian is keeper, then his profession is a profession of a very different kind. It is not the profession of the custodian, for the intellectual book is not a ticketed parcel which can be preserved by keeping it from mice and mildew on the shelf. The intellectual book is an imagined object in the mind which can be preserved only by preserving the minds perception of its presence. Neither is the librarians profession the profession of the check boy who receives and guards and redilivers,--receives from the past, guards again the present, and redelivers to the future,--for the intellectual book is not a deposit of the past which the future has a right to call and claim. The intellectual book is a construction of the spirit, and the constructions of the spirit exist in one time only--in that continuing and endless present which is Now. If it is the intellectual book rather than the physical book of which the librarian is a keeper, then the profession of the librarian is not and cannot be the neutral, passive, negative profession of the guardian and fiduciary, but must become instead the affirmative and advocating profession of the attorney for a cause. For the intellectual book is the Word. And the keepers of the Word, whether they so choose or not, must be its partisans and advocates. The Word was never yet protected by keeping it in storage in a warehouse: the preservation of the Word is now, as it has always been, a cause--perhaps the greatest--not, I think, the least in danger in this time.

        The person attacked very soon becomes infuriated by tickling sensations occuring in particularly sensitive spots--inside the ears and nostrils and in the corners of the eyes and mouth--and which it is impossible to put a stop to by means of the sudden movements we normally use to drive insects away. The bees which become heavy and, as it were, drunk with human food seem to lose the desire, and perhaps even the ability, to fly away. Their victim, weary of beating the air to no purpose, is very soon driven to striking his face, a fatal move, because the squashed, sweat-laden corpses glue the surviving insects to the spot and act as a lure for others, which are attracted by the prospect of a further meal.
        </p>
        <p>
        No doubt, the factors which determine the formation and the respective growth-rates of the different parts of the plant are present in the seed. But the dormancy of the seed, that is, the unforeseeable time which will elapse before the mechanism begins operating, does not depend upon its structure, but on an infinitely complex pattern of conditions relating to the individual history of each seed and all kinds of external influences.
        </p>
        <p>
        The same is true of civilizations. Those which we term primitive do not differ from the others in their mental equipment but only by virtue of the fact that nothing in any mental equipment ordains that it should display its resource at a given time or utilize them in a certain direction. The fact that, on one occasion in human history and perhaps arbitrarily, as being the cause of subsequent events--although we cannot be sure of this, since there is not and never will be any term of comparison--does not give us authority to transmute one historical occurrence, which can have no meaning beyond its actual happening at that place and in that time, into a proof that such a development should be demandable in all places and at all times. If such were the case, it would be too easy to conclude that, wherever such an evolution has not taken place, its absence is to be explained by the inferiority or inadequacy of societies or individuals.

        In behavioral and linguistic terms, there is little difference in describing the three events: The plant moves its roots in the direction of getting an optimum water supply when water is scarce; the bird prepares his flight south at the approach of cold weather; and the child responds with “seven” when asked for the sum of three and four. A mere external description of events does not allow us to differentiate kinds of knowledge and to ascribe knowledge to the latter two events but not to the first.
        </p>
        <p>
        The presence of a signal, e.g., the shape of a moving object, is only observed in direct connection with a response which it determines, e.g. fear reactions on the part of certain animals. The presence of a symbol, on the other hand, such as a drawing of a written message, can be recognized without external specific action. A symbol by itself demonstrates or manifests that there is a state of knowing within a living organism. Whatever objective events a symbol signifies, it does so only through the intermediary of a knowing person. Symbols abound in human life. If one wishes to investigate the symbol and the symbolic activities of men at large, one is bound to recognize the special mode of knowing which characterizes human symbolic behavior.
        </p>
        <p>
        The foundation of any living experience, the most basic psychological act in the process of adaptation or learning is what James calles the sense of “identity” or sameness. To learn through experience, even in the most primitive mode of living, means to react in a similar manner to similar kinds of stimulation, to react to some event not as completely new, but as familiar in some respects. The identity response is at the base of instinctual action patterns, of stimulus substitution in conditioned learning, and of all types of behavioral generalizations. It also lies at the root of any knowledge.
        </p>
        <p>
        If our basic needs were really just those of lower creatures much refined, we should have evolved a more realistic language than in fact we have. If the mind were essentially a recorder and transmitter, typified by the simile of telephone-exchange, we should act very differently from the way we actually do. Certainly no learning-process has caused man to believe in magic; yet word-magic is a common practice among primitive peoples and so is vicarious treatment—burning in effigy, etc.—where the proxy is plainly a mere symbol of the desired victim. Another strange, universal phenomenon is ritual. It is obviously symbolic, except where is is aimed at concrete results, and then it may be regarded as a communal form of magic. Now, all magical and ritual practices are hopelessly inappropriate to the preservation and increase of life. My cat would turn up his nose and tail to them. To regard them as mistaken attempts to control nature, as a result of wrong synapses, or crossed wires in the brain, seems to me to leave the most rational of animals too deep in the slough of error. If a savage in his ignorance of physics tries to make a mountain open its caverns by dancing round it, we must admit with shame that no rat in a psychologist’s maze would try such patently ineffectual methods of opening a door. Nor should such experiments be carried on, in the face of failure, for thousands of years; even morons should learn more quickly than that (Langer, 1964, pp. 41—42).

        </p>
        <p>
        Whatever forms our future robots take, we cannot let those forms induce us to accept anthropomorphism that robots are our equals. Robots are not like humans nor worthy of the same considerations, no matter how sophisticated they become. They are our tools and creations, to be kept in place as a subservient species by whatever methods we find necessary. Even now though, in the primitive beginning of robots, it is all too easy to follow outward appearances and act on outdated assumptions. Ordinary people who recognize a computer’s “intellectual” skills are almost irresistibly led to think of the machine as some sort of “person.” That anthropomorphic impression produces such aberrations as considering a computer a “genius,” or crediting it with substantial insight and leadership ability, while in reality it may merely be stepping with blinding speed through a simple program of trial and error. Humans are no longer alone on earth as users and generators of language; computers joined us when the mathematician John von Neumann designed a machine that could remember and transform its own instructions. That fact, though is not commonly recognized or substantially appreciated, and the anthropomorphism trap is set. Watching a computer communicate in words (and nowadays even speak aloud), the unwary will reason by analogy with their human interactions that there must be a quasi-human mind within the machine.
        </p>
        <p>
        We are supposed to believe that people are nothing more sophisticated than the machines we know how to make.
        </p>
        <p>
        Those who welcome the supposed equality of people and machines must drastically underestimate and devalue humans. Those who believe it but abhor its consequences will be compelled to reject and resist our most powerful modern technology, rather than shape it to work for their benefit.

        Loosely speaking, we might match these four components with their biological counterparts:
        Computer: “brains”
        Sense: “eyes”
        Action: “muscle”
        Autonomy: “intelligence”
       </p>
       <p>
        Developing technology
        Expanding science
        Renovating infrastructure
        Harvesting bioculture
       
        </p>
        <p>
        There is a confining scale to carbon life-forms, beyond which they cannot extend; these forms inescapably depend on their physical nerve connections. [. . .] A lizard may leave its tail behind, but only to haphazard twitching. But robots, the self-constructing silicon life-forms, have no such restrictions.
        </p>
        <p>
        Taken as an ensemble, neurons grow and develop, metabolize nutrients, process signals, capture effects from their history, and respond to their ambient environment in ways that contemporary science scarcely understands and present technology cannot reproduce. Consequently, it would not be practical, as a starting for even rudimentary artificial “brains,” to mimic biological neurons in detail.

        Range-finding with ultrasonic echoes, for example, is not conceptually different from dropping pebbles in a well and listening for a splash to judge its depth.

        Intelligence is the repertoire of information processing skills that enable a system to develop autonomously.
        </p>
        <p>
        Systems designers no longer expect that a suitably powerful machine, given an appropriate knowledge representation and enough time to contemplate its electronic navel, will eventually achieve the enlightenment to reconstruct physics, discuss literature with humans, or even walk without stumbling.
        </p>
        <p>
        Even the most powerful knowledge representation is useless if it has no content to represent. A fundamental problem with logic, computation, and knowledge representations alone is that they only allow a robot to figure out how things might be.
        </p>
        <p>
        Experts no longer believe that logic engines, by churning through their computations and deductions, will independently fill in the knowledge structures essential to intelligent autonomous robots.
        </p>
        <p>
        Advanced robots will ultimately be capable of their own view of the world. Nonetheless, humans must insist and ensure that they conform to our perspective.
        </p>
        <p>
        For robots, as with biological creatures, learning ability is simultaneously a yardstick of intelligence and the tool by which intelligence grows from experience.
        </p>
        <p>
        As the complexity and sophistication of computers begins to approach the richness of biological forms, it will become infinitely easier to produce a computer program than to understand all of that program’s effects upon a complex robotic system. Surprises will be no surprise at all.
        </p>
        <p>
        Laboratory rats will include ignore food and water while devoting all their attention to manipulating an electronically linked brain implant until they collapse. Whether or not such experiments themselves are obscene, it is impossible to view them without a dread that they foretell a tragic human deflection. A technology of addiction is only the natural compliment to our addiction to technology. “Drug” addicts of the next century may readily prefer electronic devices to chemical ingestion in their flight from reality.
        </p>
        <p>
        And if the machine’s internal models allow it to model itself, it becomes capable of self-knowledge. It knows that it is sensing; it can imagine (model) what it would sense, by redirecting its attention or taking action to change its environment. The robot’s knowledge of self can even be channeled through the same programs and processors that interpret sensory data. At that point, a computer’s consciousness will no longer be (as philosopher John Searle and others argue that it is now) simply a human figure of speech, describing symbol processing in a system that has no essential involvement with its symbols. Consciousness will be precisely the robot’s sense of self or it’s self-image.
        </p>
        <p>
        The most successful models of artificial intelligence to date do not mimic invisibly integrated human personalities at all. Instead, these systems are designed as large collections of communicating specialized agents, formed into aggregates such as “mental societies,” “beehives,” or even “armies of leprechauns.” Loosely speaking, computers are now usually referred to in English as “it” and refer to themselves as “I,” 
        [. . .] But in the future, it may be worthwhile to stop stretching the standard grammar of “I,” “you,” and “it” and invent a new category for reference to robot speakers and listeners—fourth person plural perhaps.

        <i>The Business of Criticism, Helen Gardner</i>
        </p>
        <p>
        The rudiment of criticism is not so much the power to distinguish any good poem from any bad poem, as the power to respond to a good poem and to be able to elucidate its significance, beauty, and meaning in terms which are valid for other readers.
        </p>
        <p>
        The capacity to ponder works of art and to say something which enlarges our conception of their value, or gives them a fresh relevance, is the rudiment of criticism as an art.
        </p>
        <p>
        Luckily Dr. I. A. Richards undertook the experiment of presenting poems ‘by themselves’, without even an author’s name attached, to classes of undergraduates, and published the results in Practical Criticism. The experiment proved, I think, not the incapacity of the readers, but the futility of the method. Quite apart from the inhibiting anxiety of many of the readers to say the right thing or not to be taken in, it was clear that, divorced from their human and historical context, works were deprived of their power to speak to the heart and conscience.
        </p>
        <p>
        For it is the poet’s intention which is not clear in the poem. For that reason I have to decide that it is not a wholly successful poem. [. . .] I take this poem because my sense of failure with it tells me what I mean by success as a critic: the recognition of the poem’s intention, which leaves me free to enjoy the poem. [. . .] A poem is not whatever I choose to make of it. It is something which its author made with deliberation, choosing that it should say this and not that. Whether he made it with ease, so that it ‘came right’, or with great labour, rejecting this phrase, or altering that, changing his plan mid-stream, enlarging the scope of the work, or contracting it, he made it, as far as he was able, to his own satisfaction, recognizing, when it was finished: ‘This is what I meant to say.’

        <p>
        An Essay of Dramatic Poesy, 1668. The earliest use of the term ‘the Genius of an age’ recorded in O.E.D. is 1665.
        </p>
        <p>
        The counterpoise to the necessity of ‘examining the genius of his age and the opinions of his contemporaries’, if we are to arrive at ‘a just estimate’ of a writers quality and to understand his meaning, is the necessity of learning the authors own personal language, the idiom of his thought.

        This passage is an example of the ambiguity, irony, paradox—the terms are roughly interchangeable —which professor Brooks holds to be the differentiating quality of poetic speech.

“Can't stop ain’t got no brakes!” The road ahead started to climb, and began slowing us down. At the crest of the hill, the emergency brakes finally took hold. As they had smoked and squeaked all the way down the mountain, I’d had my doubts as to whether we’d stop at all. But the wheels came to rest, and I slammed the car into park before it had a chance to roll back. [. . .]

[He] jumped out, popped the hood open with a blow of his fist, and poured the rest of his beer in the master brake cylinder reservoir. “Now, pump it,” he said. I worked the pedal, pushing the beer down the brake lines, and got my pressure back. I put the car in drive and tested the brakes. They held.
“I bet you never saw that done before,” he said, tipping back a new beer. “Bet you never learned that in college.”

<i>The Neighbor, Nathaniel S. Shaler</i>
</p>
<p>
These creatures watch our gestures, expressions, and tones of voice in the primitive way, and from them obtain marvellously clear notions of our states of mind. We are accustomed to use these grimaces and gesticulations in dealing with them, so that one can see and hear the natural man more clearly when he is dealing with his dog than at any other time.
</p>
<p>
What we have in mind is not the measure of instruction or education, not the class or station or other adventitious circumstances, but the essential traits of his being.
</p>
<p>
Here as elsewhere the art is to bring the state of mind bred of large thinking into the routine of life.
</p>
<p>
An important part of this method [. . .] is to put aside all trace of suspicion of him.
</p>
<p>
[. . .] most people, for all their contacts with their kind, never as observers attend to them.
</p>
<p>
It is not difficult, if one has a trace of the inquirer’s spirit, to change this state of mind, and in its place develop a keen curiosity concerning the fellow man.
</p>
<p>
The fact seems to be that the impressions of sight have little awakening effect upon the sympathies as compared with touch.
</p>
<p>
Thus with young children there are but two distinct categories for people; friends and enemies. As they grow to maturity the third, that of indifferent people, that may be consistently disregarded, is formed to include the greater part of mankind.
</p>
<p>
It is to be observed that the category of commonplace folk is a product of civilization, the result of crowding, and the safety which the law affords in well-organized societies.
</p>
<p>
In this condition the fellow-man is no more than a moving object which has to be avoided as one would avoid a rolling stone.
</p>
<p>
Even enmity to the neighbor is better than this trained indifference which the conditions of our massed societies induce.
</p>
<p>
We see, in a word, that people associated in passionate action constitute a new kind of human being, one that has a primitive animal nature, if so to term it be not injustice to the brutes.
</p>

Whoever does this task with reason for his guide will find that his true allegiance is due, not to bits of earth or prejudices of tribes, but to large purposes; to the great movements for advance of mankind, and to the over-ruling order of this world.

The lesson we learn from the study of crowd-madness is that the supreme need in our life is for clean individual thought and action in all that relates to the alien neighbor.
</p>
<p>
Let him face this fact with peculiar difficulties due to the fact that all which can be done has to be effected within his own soul,—wherein lies the most important difference between the betterments of human contacts and the advancement of social or political order. In this latter work we seek to make others do that which we see to be fit; in the former it is ourself we have to compel.
</p>
<p>
The truth is that the effects of the individualizing process on the status of man, the loneliness it brings and the obligation of mutual help that it entails, have not yet entered into our thought. We need the poet and the seer to give this lesson a support that science alone cannot give.

<i>The Lost Towns and Roads of America, J.R. Humphreys</i>
</p>
<p>
“The country is one of extravagant colors, of proliferating foliage and bloom, of flooding yellow sunlight and, above all perhaps, of haze. Pale blue frogs hang above the valleys in the morning, the atmosphere smokes faintly at midday and through the long slow afternoon clouds-stacks tower from the horizon and the earth-heat quivers upward through the iridescent air, blurring every outline and rendering every object vague and problematical. I know that winter comes to the land, certainly. I know there are days when the color and haze are stripped away and the real stands up in drab and depressing harshness. But these things pass and are forgotten. The dominant mood, the mood that lingers in the memory, is one of well-night drunken reverie—of a hush that seems all the deeper for the far-away mourning of the hounds and the far-away crying of the doves—of such sweet and inexorable opiates of the rich odors of hot earth and pinewood and the perfume of the magnolia in bloom—of soft languor creeping through the blood and mounting surely to the brain. . . . It is a mood, in sum, in which direct thinking is all but impossible, a mood in which the mind yields almost perforce to drift and in which the imagination holds unchecked sway, a mood in which nothing anymore seems improbable save the punny inadequateness of fact, nothing incredible save the bareness of truth . . .”

“If only one couldn't read, how beautiful Times Square would be at night”

<p>
At a curve in the road, a billboard sailed up with words that shouted: BEWARE LEST YOU FORGET THE LORD.

“What's the name of this place?” 
“Pennsylvania,” he said without an accent of any kind in particular. 
“The town?” 
He nodded. 
“Pennsylvania, Pennsylvania?”
He said it was—we drove on. 
Down at the bend at the bottom of the road we came to a house. I parked, got out and walked over to a woman who was hanging clothes on a line in the yard. 
“That town up at the top of that of the hill . . . what's the name of it?” 
“Don't think it has any name,” she said. I told her about the boy walking along the road. “He called it Pennsylvania.” 
“That’s our state. That's what we call it.” 
“I know that. But he said it was Pennsylvania, Pennsylvania and he said he’d lived there all his life.”
She shrugged. “Don’t know,” she said. “Better ask somebody else.” But there wasn't anybody else around. 
So maybe it was Pennsylvania, Pennsylvania.

In 1877, the Omaha Herald printed the following list of travel tips for stagecoach passengers:
“The best seat inside the stage is the one next to the driver. Even if you have a tendency to seasickness when riding backwards, you’ll get over it and will get less jolts and jostling. Don't let any sly elph trade you his midseat.”
</p>
<p>
“In cold weather don't ride with tight fighting boots, shoes or gloves. When the driver asks you to get off and walk, do so without grumbling. He won’t request it unless absolutely necessary. If the team runs away—sit still and take your chances. If you jumped; nine out of ten times you will get hurt.”
</p>
<p>
“In very cold weather abstain entirely from liquor when on the road; because you will freeze twice as quickly when under its influence.”
</p>
<p>
“Don't growl at the food received at the station; stage companies generally provide the best they can get. Don't keep the stage waiting. Don't smoke a strong pipe inside the coach—spit on the leeward side. If you have anything to drink in a bottle pass it around. Procure your stimulants before starting ‘ranch’ (stage depot) whiskey is not ‘nectar’.”
</p>
<p>
“Don't swear a lop over neighbors when sleeping. Take small change to pay expenses. Never shoot on the road as the noise might frighten the horses. Don't discuss politics or religion. Don't point out where murders have been committed if there are women passengers.”
</p>
<p>
“Don't lag at the wash basin. Don’t grease your hair because travel is dusty. Don’t imagine for a moment that you're going on a picnic. Expect annoyances, discomfort, and some hardship.”

Many streams have fed into the pool of black vernacular expressions. The lexicon, therefore, is a mixture of general slang, private and sometimes secret argot, specialized jargon, Africanisms, and culture-bound idioms—a far-reaching vocabulary that calls for a broad label. Also, unlike the term slang, which often gets associated with superficial or self-conscious display in talk, vernacular vocabulary suggest the important lack of affection surrounding black teenage use and the essential and natural part the vocabulary plays in teenage cognitive and expressive behavior.
</p>
<p>
Gangs also advertise on a grander scale. Whereas development companies tell you “This is mine” through a variety of signs, billboards, bus benches, or other outdoor advertising methods, gang members are more resourceful; they have to be. They preempt public spaces—building walls, freeway beams, park and bus benches, the sides and insides of buses—as free advertising spaces on which they let the world know who they are (collectively and individually), how “bad” they are, who they challenge (who challenges them), and where they do or want to claim territory. Graffiti, then, are public-free advertising. In my own neighborhood, for example, the following graffiti were taken off a local park bench.

There are three recurring images in teenage vernacular vocabulary that seem to put in perspective much of the manipulative or coercive behavior that teenagers play out in their attempts to exert power over one another’s personal and psychological space. The first is the idea of “the game”; the second, the concept of “the front”; and the third, the notion of “the action.”
</p>

Barbiturates are known in the vernacular by a variety of names, and many of these names call attention to the soporific effect barbiturates have on the central nervous system: downs, downers, stums, stumblers, slow-em-ups, fender benders, stumble bumbles. [. . .] A variety of barbiturates was available to the teenagers I encountered. Those that were commercially produced and distributed were sometimes identified by their brand name. So, for example, secobarbital, put out by the Eli Lilly Company for one, was known simply as Lillys. More often, barbiturates were identified in terms of their color. Amytal (amobarbital) was called blue, blue angel, blue heaven; Nembutal (pentobarbital), yellow, yellow jack, yellow jacket; and Tuinal (amobarbital and secobarbital), rainbow, christmas tree. The most popular barbiturate among those I talked with was secobarbital, known by the trade name of Seconal. Its popularity was attested to by the great number and variety of terms used to characterize it. Some vernacular terms identified Seconal by the color of the capsule in which the powder was encased, identifications that ranged from the literal to the metaphoric—reds, red devils, red man, red lady, red boots, red tennis shoes. Other terms associated Seconal with its commercial identification number (and potency)—F-40s, Lilly F-40s, F-60s, F-66s. Still other expressions likened Seconal to “candy” (itself a vernacular term for heroin or pills of any type)—M & Ms, gum drops, ju jus,—or some other kind of “food” that nourishes you—apples, yum yums, jellybeans, jiblets, or hors d’oeuvres (so called because they are served at parties and other social events).
</p>
<p>
Metaphors, of course, abound in the lexicon. Vernacular vocabulary by its very nature is figurative. Many of the metaphors are not only vivid, but strongly laced with irony, wit, and humour—African grape for watermelon or the extra car for public transportation or rescue station for liquor store or four sisters on thumb street for masturbation.
</p>
<p>
Of the over 2500 terms I have collected in almost nine years, fully 75 percent of the expressions represented in the lexicon are known to black teenagers, and approximately 50 percent of those terms are claimed as active words and phrases in teenage vocabularies. That information is significant. For one, it suggests the degree to which there is a continuity of experience—both good and bad, painful and poignant—from generation to generation which continues to be aptly characterized by long-standing vernacular terminology. It also suggests that vernacular vocabulary is more conservative than innovative in its development—that is, one relies on perennials to do one’s work, as long as they accurately mirror one’s life and times. And even those terms that have been dropped (at least for the time being) are still retained in the collective lexicon of a given group.
</p>
<p>
Two related sources of vernacular vocabulary are the black disc jockey, with his patter or advertising “riff,” and the black singer.
</p>
<p>
Billboards in South Central Los Angeles and in other black communities reflect back terms and expressions that are part of the vernacular—and those products that will appeal to a black audience.
</p>
<p>
Some favorite vernacular sources were “Baretta,” “Kojak,” “Police Story,” “Streets of San Francisco,” “The Rookies”—all police shows. All violent.

<i>Toys in America, Marshall and Inez McClintock</i>

<p>
For play is a child’s work, the activity through which he learns about himself, about other people, about materials and basic mechanics, basic physics. Toys and games teach him to observe, to reason, to remember, to build, and to coordinate muscles, eyes, and the mind.

When grownups worked hard and enjoyed few amusements, children played little and owned few toys. Real wars always brought a deluge of war toys. When adults passed through a period of wild fads, their children had silly toys. When grownups were primarily concerned with acquiring more and more material possessions, children asked for more and more toys. New inventions inevitably brought along their toy counterparts, except in a few instances when the toys foreshadowed adult realites. For example, at this writing there are no space stations, but any child can buy one in a toy store.

    <i>Foolish Figleaves?, Richard H. Kuh</i>
    New York, had, by statute, declared it to be a misdemeanor to sell amy publication “principally made up of criminal news, police reports, or accounts of criminal deeds, or pictures, or stories of deeds of bloodshed, lust or crime . . .” In 1941, Murray Winters, operator of a bookshop, was convicted under that statute. He had been found in possession of more than two thousand copies of Headquarters Detective, a magazine hardly designed as a law enforcement aid. “The stories are embellished with pictures of fiendish and gruesome crimes,” New York’s intermediate appellate judge had observed, “and are besprinkled with lurid photographs of victims and perpetrators. Featured articles bear such titles as ‘Bargains in Bodies,” ‘Girl Slave to a Love Cult,’ and ‘Girls’ Reformatory.’’ The New York courts sustained Winters’ conviction, only one of the state’s seven highest judges deeming the statute too vague to be enforceable.

The Roth formulation, at first glance, may not seem difficult. Legally actionable obscenity exists, the five Justices declared, if “to the average person, applying contemporary community standards, the dominant theme of the material taken as a whole appeals to prurient interest” and is “utterly without redeeming social importance.” (p. 34)
In his 1955 opinion, ordering the injunction, Judge Levy had described the content of [Nights of Horror], in part, these words: “Nights of Horror” was no haphazard title. Perverted sexual acts and macabre tortures of the human body are repeatedly depicted. The books contain numbers of acts of male torturing female and some vice versa—by most ingenious means. These gruesome acts included such horrors as cauterizing a woman’s breast with a hot iron, placing hot irons against a woman’s armpits, pulling of a girl’s fingernails with white-hot pincers, completely singeing away the body hairs, working a female’s skin away from her flesh with a knife, gouging and burning eyes of out their sockets, ringing the nipples of the breast with needles . . . Sucking a victim’s blood was pictured; and so was pouring molten lead into a girl’s mouth and ears; and putting honey on a girl’s breasts, vagina and buttocks—and then putting hundreds of great red ants on the honey. Sodomy, rape, lesbianism, seduction prevail. Youngsters disrobing in the presence of and to the detailed recorded delight of elderly males was described. Incidental training of the teen-ager to narcotic addiction and sexual perversion was part of the activities engaged in.
